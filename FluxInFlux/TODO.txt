AST structure:

			(predec) ASTNode (class/interface declarations)
			(header) ASTNode (declarations)

Parsing
	[x]	Add templated classes

	[x]	Add @flagdef, @flagcdef
	[x]	List comprehensions
	[ ] Finish & close rewrite/parsing-definitions branch

		[ ] Allow enums to specify primitive values for members
	[ ]	Vararg functions
	[ ]	Change unary operator parsing to allow for different precedences.
	[ ]	Add `A if C else B` syntax
	[ ]	Sort out file importing

	[ ]	Add preprocessor instruction support
	[ ] Add some sort of foreign function/variable/class interface

Type checking
	[ ] Add class/interface/enum pre-declaration from AST headers

Compilation
	Everything :/

Optimisation
	Everything :/

Standard library
	Everything :/


First, need to fix file importing. (Parse time) Files need to keep a list of classes.
Result could look something like this:

{FileStart: name = X}
{FileStart: name = a, classes = {"a", "b", "c"}}
{Normal AST}
{FileEnd}
{FileImport: name = a}
{Normal AST}
{FileEnd}

Import all the headers, then import all the .flx/.lua etc

(Compile time) use the Context or Source or whatever class it is to keep a track of definitions (each file has a IRDefinitionHeap, track by name/path without extension to avoid .flx being different from .flxh)
Since classes will be defined at the FileStart, there will never be any issues with referencing types that don't exist if the file is imported at some point.
A FileImport ASTNode should add all the public definitions/classes of the imported file to the current file's scope (not heap).
